My name is Owen, and I'm a current senior at the University of Michigan studying statistics and economics! 

I most recently worked as a Research Analyst Intern at The Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm, where I managed terabyte-scale datasets for a multibillion-dollar technology lawsuit. Before that, I conducted research in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan, applying advanced sketching algorithms to forecast extreme solar flares. Earlier, I interned at TRC Companies, a consulting and engineering firm, as a Business Intelligence Intern.

I’m particularly interested in big data analytics, natural language processing, and data science for economics. I’m always eager to learn more about careers and opportunities in data science and analytics, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss ideas!
