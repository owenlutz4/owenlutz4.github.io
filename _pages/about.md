My name is Owen, and I'm a current senior at the University of Michigan studying statistics and economics! 

I most recently worked as a Research Analyst Intern at The Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm, where I managed terabyte-scale datasets for a multibillion-dollar technology lawsuit. Before that, I conducted research in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan, applying advanced sketching algorithms to forecast extreme solar flares. Earlier, I interned at TRC Companies, a consulting and engineering firm, as a Business Intelligence Intern.

I’m particularly interested in big data analytics, natural language processing, and data science for economics. I’m always eager to learn more about careers and opportunities in data science and analytics, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss ideas!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
